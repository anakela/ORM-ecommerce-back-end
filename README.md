## Overview

### The Challenge

> Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

> Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

> Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

### User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## My Process

### Built With

- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Node.js
- Sequelize.js
- MySQL
- DOTENV

### What I Learned

This challenge gave me a much better understanding of routes and models and how they interact.  In addition, I was able to practice using `Sequelize` rather than `MySQL` to query the database, something that I haven't been very comfortable with in the past.

Being able to use and understand `express` routes to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE database items was a very interesting aspect of this project.  For the most part, they worked very well.

That being said, had difficulty with two of my routes/database queries:
- GET - Update Product
- GET - Update Tag

For both of these, I received `400 Bad Request` errors for both of these requests, and was shown empty objects in Insomnia's preview window.  When I checked the database in MySQL Workbench, however, the changes to the database were actually rendered.  (This can be seen in the walkthrough video as well as the screenshots below.)
